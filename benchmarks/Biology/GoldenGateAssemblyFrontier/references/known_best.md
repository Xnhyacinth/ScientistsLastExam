# GoldenGateAssemblyFrontier reference record

## 1. Frozen scientific object

The scored object is a complete ordered fragment assembly for each synthetic target. Junctions are
not free words: each is the four-base overlap physically present at one adjacent fragment boundary.
The product must reconstruct the target exactly and contain no recognition site for the selected
enzyme condition.

## 2. Data provenance

Each workbook is 257 by 257 including labels, hence a 256 by 256 count matrix. Row labels equal the
reverse complements of the lexicographically ordered column labels. The sparse 24-class extraction
has SHA-256 `f6cf8c7ff9cf73a85e56085092c0cc725b01dbf7f3c77ce9a840c312b4486f50`.
`references/extract_pryor_ligation_counts.py` rebuilds it from prefetched source files and optionally
checks all cells against the fixed OMEGA `160be2f` CSV mirror. The committed replay receipt records
a successful builder replay and explicitly leaves independent source replay pending.

## 3. Measured anchors

| instance | baseline F | reference F | reference enzyme |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| dev_a | 0.357734140583 | 0.981847600177 | BsmBI-v2 |
| dev_b | 0.408787569678 | 0.912298512850 | BbsI-HF |
| dev_c | 0.634301231956 | 0.993554931378 | Esp3I |
| heldout_a | 0.391224288743 | 0.975436592666 | Esp3I |
| heldout_b | 0.538027379186 | 0.970806376807 | BsaI-HFv2 |

The baseline is the public even-spacing construction in `solution.py`. The reference uses only the
public target, enzyme descriptions and count matrices. It takes the better of width-8 and width-32
beam searches after four coordinate-refinement passes. Score is uncapped remaining-gap log progress
toward log fidelity `-0.001` (~99.9% predicted F); that witness lands near combined score `0.54`,
not at one.

## 4. Headroom and ablation

A width-128, eight-refinement-pass search is not uniformly better than the width-32 witness
(partial-set fidelity is not a monotone admissible bound). The executable headroom program takes,
per instance, the better of the two; it strictly improves development combined score above the
witness. Wider search is not uniformly better because a wide beam can prune a lower-scoring
partial set that later avoids crosstalk. This makes held-out reporting load-bearing.

## 5. Failure and shortcut probes

Exclusive tests pin rejection of empty output, one-fragment output, wrong overlap orientation,
target mutation, out-of-range fragment length, duplicate reverse-complement class and selection of
an enzyme whose recognition site occurs internally. They also prove that adding an unused table
row cannot change the submitted pool's fidelity.

## 6. Interpretation limit

These are predictions under one measured ligation-frequency assay and four enzyme conditions. No
assembly was physically built for the synthetic targets. Promotion requires independent synthetic-
biology review, clean sandbox replay and frozen frontier-model calibration.

## 7. Model draws and construction errors

No frozen frontier-model calibration has been run; builder model identity was not recorded.
Lineage is incomplete_legacy and this task is excluded from RECORDED_LINEAGE.
The former evaluator recomputed its reference search in each fresh evaluation process, even
for invalid submissions. Anchors are now constants guarded by explicit full recomputation.
The former Task.md omitted the development-mean definition; that omission is repaired.

## 8. Maintainer shortcut measurements

Source: PR #18 comment by Geniusyingmanji, 2026-09-08, head f3e553d.
Greedy: infeasible, 0.000000. Beam width 2: 0.078686 development.
Beam width 8 without refinement: 0.429900 development / 0.130161 heldout.
Reference: 0.536922 / 0.501698. Refinement adds about 0.11 development and 0.37 heldout.
A wider search previously measured 1.014924 / 0.660575. These are algorithm measurements,
not model draws or proof of difficulty. The score-one target is an engineering target, not a
published experimental record.
