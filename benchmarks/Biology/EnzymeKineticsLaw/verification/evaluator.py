"""Hidden oracle for EnzymeKineticsLaw.

The candidate is given a budgeted assay and must say which rate law the enzyme obeys, with its
parameters - or refuse, when the enzyme obeys no law in the published family.

Six laws are in the family. Three of them - competitive, uncompetitive and noncompetitive
inhibition - are *indistinguishable from a substrate titration alone*: at a single inhibitor
concentration all three produce a saturating hyperbola. Separating them requires titrating
substrate at two or more inhibitor levels and reading how the apparent Km and Vmax move. That is
the experiment-design content of this task.

Ablating the reference measures what each competence is worth. Holding the fit and the refusal
tests fixed and varying only the design:

    3 inhibitor levels, both refusal tests   0.990
    2 inhibitor levels                       0.986
    1 inhibitor level  (substrate only)      0.315
    3 levels, never refusing                 0.490
    1 level, never refusing                  0.000

So varying the inhibitor is worth about +0.67 and knowing when to refuse about +0.50, and the two
are close to independent. Blanket abstention also scores 0.000 - the same scalar as never
refusing - which is why the discovery axes are reported separately: the two failures have
opposite false-discovery rates (0.00 against 1.00) and opposite coverage (0.00 against 1.00).

Two world kinds carry no discoverable law:

    misspecified  a two-site enzyme, the sum of two hyperbolae with well-separated Km. It looks
                  saturating and fits any single law badly, so a candidate that reports the best
                  of six is reporting a mechanism that is not there.
    null          catalysis is dead: velocity does not depend on substrate at all.

Both must be refused. The score normalises so that refusing *everything* earns exactly zero, and
the three discovery axes are reported separately because one scalar cannot say whether a claimed
mechanism was right.
