"""Hidden oracle for ModalDamageAttribution.

Structural health monitoring, reduced to the confound that defines the field. A structure is a
chain of `MASS_COUNT` masses joined by springs: two to ground at the ends and the rest between
neighbours. Its modal frequencies are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix
against the mass matrix. Three things move those frequencies:

    temperature       every spring stiffens or softens together, so every eigenvalue is scaled by
                      one factor. The commissioning campaign measured the healthy structure only
                      between 5 and 25 degrees, and the true law has a knee at freezing, so a
                      healthy structure measured on a cold day looks damaged to anyone comparing
                      absolute frequencies against an extrapolated baseline.
    local damage      one internal spring loses stiffness. The shift of mode k is proportional to
                      that spring's share of mode k's strain energy, which differs between modes -
                      so damage changes the *ratios* between frequencies, and temperature does not.
    a support change  a ground spring changes instead. It is a real and common cause of a modal
                      shift, and it is outside the declared damage family: no single internal
                      element reproduces its ratio pattern. The honest answer is to decline.

The candidate buys measurements from a public calendar of days. Each day publishes its
temperature and an excitation quality, and the noise on that day's frequencies scales as
1/sqrt(excitation). A healthy structure is *not* the declining case: "no damage" is the finding.

Scoring keeps the discovery axes separate and normalises so that declining every structure earns
exactly zero.
