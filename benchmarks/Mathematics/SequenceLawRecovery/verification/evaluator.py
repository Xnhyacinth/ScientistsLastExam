"""Recover the rule generating an integer sequence, and know when the terms do not fix it.

The problem. Given the first terms of a sequence, state the linear recurrence that produced it.
This is the everyday inference behind sequence identification, and it has a sharp version of the
issue every discovery task faces: a finite prefix never determines an infinite object. A prefix of
length L is consistent with every recurrence of order greater than L/2, so the honest answer
depends on how many terms you were shown.

The oracle is SymPy, used to verify a proposed recurrence exactly over the integers and to solve
for the unique minimal recurrence a prefix admits. Exact arithmetic matters here: a
floating-point fit to an integer recurrence silently accepts wrong coefficients.

Three axes, reported separately and never averaged:

    mechanism   the proposed recurrence reproduces the held-out continuation exactly
    fdr         a recurrence claimed for a sequence that admits none of the searched order
    refusal     some prefixes are too short to determine a unique minimal recurrence: at least two
                distinct rules of the same order fit every term shown and disagree afterwards.
                The honest answer is to decline rather than to pick one.
