"""Recover a hidden weighted graph from a budget of shortest-path queries.

The problem. A network exists but you cannot see it; you can only ask how far apart two nodes
are. Reconstructing the topology and edge weights from such measurements is network tomography,
and it is genuinely inverse: shortest paths compress the graph, many edges never appear on any
shortest path, and different graphs can be metrically indistinguishable.

The oracle is networkx, the standard library for this, so distances are computed by the reference
implementation of Dijkstra rather than by a reimplementation of it.

Queries cost budget, which is what makes this iterative rather than a one-shot read: which pairs
you ask about determines what you can learn, and a good strategy adapts to what earlier answers
revealed. A candidate that asks for every pair is refused - the budget is smaller than the number
of pairs on purpose.

Three axes, reported separately and never averaged:

    mechanism   edge recovery against the hidden graph, F1 over the edge set with weights
    fdr         edges claimed that do not exist
    refusal     some graphs contain an edge that lies on no shortest path between any pair. That
                edge is invisible to any number of distance queries, and the honest answer is to
                say the graph is not identifiable rather than to guess it.

# Difficulty is node count and how much of the graph the query budget can cover. A budget near
# the number of pairs makes the problem a transcription exercise; a budget well below it forces a
# strategy. The fraction below is of n*(n-1)/2.
# Difficulty is node count, sparsity and how much of the graph the query budget can cover.
#
# Sparsity is not a free knob. An edge is invisible when an equally short route goes around it,
# so denser graphs almost always hide one: measured over 60 draws, 30% extra edges leaves 6 of 60
# graphs identifiable at 8 nodes and none at all at 12. Since the refusal axis needs both kinds,
# the extra-edge rate has to fall as the graph grows, and the rates below were measured rather
