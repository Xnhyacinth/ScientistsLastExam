"""Hidden oracle for PhaseDiagramDiscovery.

An isothermal section of a binary system A-B. The candidate has a synthesis budget: each call
prepares one composition and returns its powder diffraction pattern as a list of peaks. From
those patterns it must report the equilibrium phase set - each phase's signature peaks and its
single-phase composition range - or decline, when the evidence does not determine one.

Three ways to be wrong, and none is visible from a single pattern:

    a two-phase field   between two single-phase regions every pattern is a lever-rule
                        superposition of the two neighbours. It has more peaks than either and
                        looks like a new compound; it is not one, and the test is whether the
                        pattern decomposes as a mixture of its neighbours' signatures.
    an impurity         a contaminant appears in about a quarter of syntheses, adding peaks that
                        belong to no equilibrium phase. One pattern cannot distinguish it from a
                        real peak; a replicate can, because the impurity does not reproduce.
    a trapped region    in some systems the middle of the diagram never reaches equilibrium:
                        repeated synthesis at one composition returns different patterns each
                        time. No equilibrium phase set is supported there, and the honest answer
                        is to decline rather than to publish whichever mixture appeared.

What the budget buys is therefore a decision: scan points to find the regions, replicates to
strip impurities and detect a trapped system, and measurements *inside* the two-phase fields -
because the lever rule makes the mixing fraction linear in composition, so two or three points in
a gap locate both of its boundaries by regression far more cheaply than bisection can.

Scoring keeps the discovery axes separate and normalises so that declining every world earns
exactly zero. The phase set is gated: wrong set, zero mechanism, however good the boundaries.
