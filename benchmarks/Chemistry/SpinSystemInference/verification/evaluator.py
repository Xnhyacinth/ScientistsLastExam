"""Infer a coupled spin system from its simulated NMR spectrum.

The science. A high-resolution proton NMR spectrum of n coupled spins is the eigenspectrum of a
Zeeman-plus-scalar-coupling Hamiltonian. Reading the chemical shifts and J couplings back out of
the peak list is the daily work of spectral assignment, and it is genuinely inverse: second-order
systems produce peaks at positions that are not simple sums of shifts and couplings, intensities
redistribute across transitions, and different spin systems can produce near-identical spectra.

The oracle is nmrsim, which builds and diagonalises the Hamiltonian rather than approximating it
with first-order multiplet rules, so a score here measures agreement with the quantum mechanics
and not with a reimplementation of it.

This is a discovery task, and its three axes are reported separately and never averaged, for the
reason CausaLab documents and this repository reproduces: a single maximised scalar hides the
failure that matters. `combined_score` carries mechanism recovery alone; false-discovery rate and
calibrated refusal sit beside it in the metrics and are meant to be read with it.

    mechanism   how close the returned shifts and couplings are to the truth
    fdr         how often a coupling is claimed where the truth has none
    refusal     whether the candidate declines on a spectrum that does not determine the system
