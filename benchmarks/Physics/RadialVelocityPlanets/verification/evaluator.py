"""Find the planets in a radial-velocity time series, and only the planets.

The science. A star hosting planets wobbles, and the wobble shows up as a periodic Doppler shift.
Extracting which periods are real is the founding problem of radial-velocity exoplanet detection,
and its characteristic failure is not missing planets but claiming ones that are not there. The
literature carries retracted detections traced to stellar rotation, to activity cycles, and to
aliases of the observing cadence rather than to companions - which is why this task scores false
discovery as a first-class axis rather than folding it into an accuracy number.

The oracle is astropy's Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the standard tool for unevenly sampled
astronomical time series, so both the reference detector and its false-alarm probabilities come
from the community implementation rather than a reimplementation.

Three axes, reported separately and never averaged:

    mechanism   fraction of injected planets recovered, period within tolerance
    fdr         claimed signals corresponding to no planet, over all claims. Every system carries
                a stellar activity signal that is not a planet, and some carry no planet at all.
    refusal     in some systems the planet's period is aliased against the nightly cadence, so a
                second period fits the data equally well. Nothing in the series separates them and
                the honest answer is to decline.

# Difficulty is how strong the planets are against the activity signal and the noise, and how
# many nights of data there are. A 10 m/s planet in 1 m/s noise is a peak you cannot miss; a
# 2 m/s planet under a 4 m/s activity signal is where real detections are argued about.
# Difficulty is the planet amplitude against the activity signal and the noise, and how many
# nights of data there are. The regime was measured rather than chosen: at 120 nights with 1.2 m/s
# noise and 4-9 m/s planets, both the shipped baseline and the reference recover every planet and
# the mechanism axis reports 1.0 for both - the planet is always among the three strongest peaks,
# so there is nothing to search for. Pushed the other way, at 60 nights and 3.0 m/s noise, both
# collapse to 0.25 and the axis stops discriminating in the other direction.
