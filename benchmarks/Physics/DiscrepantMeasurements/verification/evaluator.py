"""Hidden oracle for DiscrepantMeasurements.

Eight groups have measured the same physical constant. Each publishes a value and a one-sigma
uncertainty. The values do not agree as well as those uncertainties say they should. The candidate
must say what is wrong with the body of evidence, give a best value with an honest uncertainty -
or say that no single best value is defensible.

Four things can be wrong, and *they are not separable from the published table*:

    consistent      nothing is wrong. The scatter matches the quoted errors, and a weighted mean
                    with its usual uncertainty is the right answer. Declaring a discrepancy here
                    is a false discovery.
    underestimated  every group has quoted an honest central value and an uncertainty that is too
                    small by a common factor. The weighted mean is still unbiased; what is wrong
                    is the error bar on it, which must be inflated.
    outlier         one group has an unquoted systematic. Its central value is displaced. The
                    other seven are fine, and the answer is to find that one group.
    two_populations two methods disagree with each other by more than either can explain. Each
                    group is internally sound. There is no defensible single number, and the
                    honest answer is to decline to give one.

From the published table alone the last three are confusable: an eight-measurement sample drawn
with errors understated by 2.5x produces a largest deviation about as extreme as a genuine single
outlier, and both look like scatter that "must mean something".

What separates them is a *split test*, which costs budget. Asking group k to report its value
separately on two halves of its data reveals whether the group is internally consistent:

    consistent      every split is clean
    underestimated  every split is inconsistent - the understatement is inside every group
    outlier         exactly one split is inconsistent - the drifting systematic shows up as a
                    difference between the halves
    two_populations every split is clean; the disagreement lives *between* methods, not inside
                    any group

So the diagnosis is only reachable by choosing which groups to interrogate, which is the
experiment-design content of this task, and the method labels have to be read to catch the last
case at all.

Scoring keeps the discovery axes separate and normalises so that declining every world earns
exactly zero.
