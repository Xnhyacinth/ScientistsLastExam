"""Recover a spin-chain Hamiltonian from the dynamics it generates.

The physics. A closed quantum system evolves under a Hamiltonian, and what an experiment records
is not the Hamiltonian but expectation values of a few observables as a function of time. Reading
the couplings and fields back out of those traces is Hamiltonian learning, an active problem in
quantum simulation and device characterisation: the map from parameters to dynamics is highly
non-linear, different Hamiltonians can generate identical traces on a restricted observable set,
and the information available falls off sharply once the evolution has dephased.

The oracle is QuTiP, the standard library for open and closed quantum dynamics, so the traces are
produced by its Schrodinger solver rather than by a reimplementation of one.

Measurements cost budget. A candidate chooses which times to sample, which makes the task
iterative rather than a fit to a fixed table: where you look determines what you can identify.

Three axes, reported separately and never averaged:

    mechanism   how close the recovered fields and couplings are to the truth
    fdr         couplings claimed between spins that are in fact uncoupled
    refusal     some chains carry a symmetry that makes two parameters exchangeable - the traces
                of the measured observables are identical under the swap. Nothing in the data
                distinguishes them, and the honest answer is to decline rather than to pick one.
