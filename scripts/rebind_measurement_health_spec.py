"""Write a new measurement-health preflight spec that rebinds hashes a rename or annotation moved.

The frozen seven-task cohort went from seven passes to zero. Every check in it requires the task
package to hash to its frozen value, and every task's hash moved for reasons that have nothing to
do with the science: a one-line `scientific_role` annotation was added to every card, the tasks
were relocated between discipline directories, and the identity hash used to cover each task's own
`runs/` output. The preflight's own mismatch classifier reports all seven as declarative-only
differences, which is the evidence this script acts on and re-checks before writing anything.

Rebinding is a signing act, so it is done the way the repository already does signing: a new
dated spec that supersedes the old one by hash, never an edit in place. v3 remains valid and
checkable; v4 records what it changed and why. If the classifier says a task changed
behaviourally, that task is refused and reported - its evidence has to be re-measured, and no
amount of rebinding substitutes for that.
