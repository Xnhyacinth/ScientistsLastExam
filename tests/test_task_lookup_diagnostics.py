"""`find_task`'s failure message has to survive the tail-slice that reports it.

Every `frontier_eval/run_eval.py` reports a failed evaluation by keeping the last 500
characters of stderr, and `error_message` is one of the few keys a searcher can see. A
message that names the whole inventory is longer than that, so the reader gets a fragment of
the task list where the reason should be - the most common wrapper failure there is, since a
mistyped or unregistered task id is exactly what checkpoint 23 exists to catch.

These tests pin the properties that make the message usable rather than its wording.
