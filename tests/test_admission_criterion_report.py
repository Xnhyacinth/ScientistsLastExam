"""The admission report decides which tasks this benchmark can claim, so its rules are pinned.

Four defects were found in it by inspection rather than by test, and each one changed what the
report said about the inventory:

  * runs were identified by directory name, which invented a task called "b20" out of a
    budget-sweep cohort and split one task's evidence across fictitious names;
  * open-loop seeds were not pooled across cohorts, which would have made a seeding pass useless
    because the new cohort and the old one each stayed below the confidence threshold;
  * one row was emitted per (task, cohort), so a pooled saturation verdict was counted once per
    cohort and 52 tasks were reported as 93 rows;
  * the judged cohort was picked by seed count, so a task was judged on a cohort holding a single
    budget and the verdict read "gap grows with budget, +0.1345 at 3 to +0.1345 at 3".

Each of those is a test below.
